"""
In this kata, you are given the sum of the number of vertices, edges, and faces of an

N-sided prism, which is equal to s. Your task is to determine and return a tuple containing four values: the number of vertices, edges,

faces, and the number of sides of the base of the prism.

A prism is a polyhedron with two parallel, congruent bases and rectangular lateral faces connecting the corresponding sides of the bases.

triangular prism example:

For an N-sided prism:

Vertices (V): The total number of vertices.

Edges (E): The total number of edges.

Faces (F): The total number of faces.

Base sides (B): The number of sides of the base of the prism.

Given the sum 𝑠 = 𝑉 + 𝐸 + 𝐹, return the tuple (V ,E ,F ,B).
